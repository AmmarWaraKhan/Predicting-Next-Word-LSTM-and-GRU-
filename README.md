# ðŸ“Œ Project Title: LSTM and GRU Based Next Word Prediction

## âœ… Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end deep learning application that predicts the next word in a sentence using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** and **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)** neural network models. The goal is to understand sequential data processing in NLP and build a model that generates text based on learned patterns.
